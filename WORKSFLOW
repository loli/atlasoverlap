Flair_orig --(elastix_moving)--> TemplateFlair_mni => Trans1
Flair_orig --(resampling)--> Flair_sub => Trans2 [already existant]
GT_orig =[T1]=> GT_mni
Segm_sub =[T2^-1]=> Segm_orig =[T1]=> Segm_mni

Finally evaluate and compare region overlaps between GT_mni and Segm_mni

Things to do
############
- Create a head mask [done]
- Check head masks [done; huge differences in intensity observed!]
- Up-Sample the segmentations and brainmasks to original space [done; and noted that medpy_resample.py performs better than IMIImageResample!]
- Evaluate the resulting segmentations against the original space ground truth using the upssampled brainmasks [done; gives better results than standard appraoch (IMIImageResample)]
- Register all flairs in the 00originals folder to the flair MNI template (using thresholded images to remove background!). [done]
- Check the results visually, especially in how far the lesion has been distorted! [done]
- If to much distortion: use lesion results Segm_orig as mask! [did not happen]
- Transfom segmentations to MNI space [done; required morphological closing, which could have increased the segmentation size]
- Transform ground truth to MNI space [done]
- Evaluate in MNI space [done]
- Compare region-overlaps with different atlases as evaluation! [done]
