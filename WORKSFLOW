Method
######

Flair_orig --(elastix_moving)--> TemplateFlair_mni => Trans1
Flair_orig --(resampling)--> Flair_sub => Trans2 [already existant]
GT_orig =[T1]=> GT_mni
Segm_sub =[T2^-1]=> Segm_orig =[T1]=> Segm_mni

Finally evaluate and compare region overlaps between GT_mni and Segm_mni

Things to do
############
- Create a head mask [done]
- Check head masks [done; huge differences in intensity observed!]
- Register all flairs in the 00originals folder to the flair MNI template (using thresholded images to remove background!).
- Check the results visually, especially in how far the lesion has been distorted!
- If to much distortion: use lesion results Segm_orig as mask!
